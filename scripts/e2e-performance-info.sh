echo "=================================================="
echo ""

echo "📊 Current Configuration:"
echo "  Workers (CI): 30 (dramatically increased from 2)"
echo "  Workers (Local): Auto-detected"
echo "  Retries (CI): 1 (reduced for faster feedback)"
echo "  Retries (Local): 0"

echo "🎯 Testing Modes Available:"
echo ""
echo "  💨 ULTRA-FAST (Smoke Tests)"
echo "     Command: npm run test:e2e:smoke"
echo "     Duration: ~12 seconds"
echo "     Tests: 9 critical path tests"
echo "     Browsers: Chromium only"
echo "     Use: Development feedback, CI primary"
echo ""
echo "  ⚡ FAST (Chromium Only)"
echo "     Command: npm run test:e2e:fast"
echo "     Duration: ~5 minutes"
echo "     Tests: ~444 comprehensive tests"
echo "     Browsers: Chromium only"
echo "     Use: PR validation, thorough testing"
