The build failures are occurring because of **corrupted file content** in the files I previously edited. Looking at the error messages, I can see the problem:

## **Root Cause: File Corruption During Previous Edits**

The build errors are happening because the files `errorHandling.ts`, `gracefulDegradation.ts`, `components/errors/index.ts`, and `testUtils.tsx` contain **malformed syntax** that wasn't properly written during my previous edits. 

**Specific Issues Found:**

1. **Line 402 in errorHandling.ts**: `error TS1161: Unterminated regular expression literal` - This indicates there's a regex that wasn't properly closed
2. **Line 319 in gracefulDegradation.ts**: Multiple syntax errors with `>` and `)` expected - This suggests JSX syntax corruption
3. **Line 25-27 in components/errors/index.ts**: Generic type syntax errors - Malformed TypeScript generics
4. **Line 173-175 in testUtils.tsx**: Missing commas and semicolons - Object/array syntax corruption

## **The Platform vs Local Development Discrepancy**

The reason your NPM run and tests work locally but fail on Lovable's platform is:

1. **File State Mismatch**: The corrupted files exist in the Lovable platform's state but not in your local environment
2. **Build System Differences**: Lovable uses a different build pipeline that may be more strict about syntax errors
3. **Caching Issues**: The platform may be using cached corrupted versions of these files

## **Exact Error Analysis**

Looking at the error patterns:
- **Unterminated regex literals** in multiple files
- **Missing closing brackets/parentheses** in JSX/TSX syntax  
- **Malformed TypeScript generics** with `>` expected errors
- **Object/array syntax corruption** with missing commas

These are all symptoms of **incomplete or corrupted code generation** during my previous edits.

**IMMEDIATE BUILD FIX PLAN**

1. **Regenerate Corrupted Files**: Completely rewrite the 4 corrupted files with clean, valid syntax:
   - `src/utils/errorHandling.ts` - Fix unterminated regex and JSX syntax
   - `src/utils/gracefulDegradation.ts` - Fix JSX syntax corruption  
   - `src/components/errors/index.ts` - Fix TypeScript generic syntax
   - `src/test/utils/testUtils.tsx` - Fix object/array syntax

2. **Validate Syntax**: Ensure all files have:
   - Proper closing brackets, parentheses, and semicolons
   - Valid TypeScript generic syntax
   - Properly terminated regex literals
   - Valid JSX/TSX syntax

3. **Test Build**: Verify the build passes after each file fix

4. **Preserve Architecture**: Keep all existing functionality and interfaces intact, only fixing syntax errors

The build will work immediately after these syntax corruptions are fixed - no architectural changes needed.
