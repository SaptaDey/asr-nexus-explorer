# Meta-Analysis & Advanced Visualizations Guide

## Overview

The ASR-GoT framework now includes sophisticated meta-analysis capabilities that can collect datasets from scientific literature, harmonize data from multiple sources, and generate advanced biomedical visualizations. This feature is specifically designed for in-depth scientific research queries like chromosomal instabilities in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL).

## Key Features

### üîç **Comprehensive Dataset Collection**
- **Literature Mining**: Automatically searches peer-reviewed scientific papers for relevant datasets
- **Repository Integration**: Identifies datasets from public repositories (GEO, ArrayExpress, SRA, etc.)
- **Supplementary File Detection**: Extracts data from supplementary materials, figures, and tables
- **Quality Assessment**: Evaluates dataset completeness, reliability, and relevance

### üß¨ **Advanced Data Processing**
- **Data Harmonization**: Standardizes variable names and formats across multiple datasets
- **Multi-source Integration**: Combines datasets from different studies and platforms
- **Quality Filtering**: Removes low-quality or irrelevant datasets automatically
- **Statistical Validation**: Performs quality checks and data integrity validation

### üìä **Sophisticated Visualizations**
- **Box and Violin Plots**: Age-stratified chromosomal aberration analysis
- **Correlation Heatmaps**: Disease stage vs genomic features
- **Survival Analysis**: Kaplan-Meier curves by aberration load
- **Network Analysis**: Genomic feature correlation networks
- **Principal Component Analysis**: Dimensionality reduction of genomic data
- **Statistical Testing**: Integrated ANOVA, correlation tests, and log-rank tests

## How It Works

### 1. **Dataset Collection Pipeline**

```typescript
// Example query
const query = "chromosomal instabilities in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma staging progression";

// Collection process
1. Literature Search ‚Üí Identifies papers with datasets
2. Data Extraction ‚Üí Extracts tables, figures, supplementary files
3. Quality Assessment ‚Üí Scores relevance, completeness, reliability
4. Data Download ‚Üí Retrieves raw datasets from repositories
```

### 2. **Data Harmonization Process**

The system automatically maps variables across datasets:

```typescript
// Variable harmonization mapping
{
  'age': ['age', 'age_years', 'patient_age', 'age_at_diagnosis'],
  'stage': ['stage', 'disease_stage', 'clinical_stage', 'tumor_stage'],
  'survival_months': ['survival_months', 'overall_survival', 'os_months'],
  'chromosomal_losses': ['chromosomal_losses', 'chr_losses', 'deletion_count'],
  'chromosomal_gains': ['chromosomal_gains', 'chr_gains', 'amplification_count']
}
```

### 3. **Advanced Visualization Generation**

The system generates multiple visualization types based on available data:

#### **Age-Stratified Analysis**
- Creates age groups (< 30, 30-44, 45-59, 60-74, ‚â• 75)
- Generates box plots for chromosomal losses and gains by age group
- Performs ANOVA testing for statistical significance

#### **Disease Progression Heatmaps**
- Correlates disease stage (I-IV) with genomic features
- Visualizes mean aberration counts per stage
- Includes statistical annotations and p-values

#### **Survival Analysis**
- Stratifies patients by aberration burden (high vs low)
- Generates Kaplan-Meier survival curves
- Performs log-rank tests for group comparisons

#### **Correlation Networks**
- Calculates Pearson correlations between genomic features
- Visualizes significant correlations (|r| > 0.3) as network graphs
- Color-codes positive (red) and negative (blue) correlations
