  - Protected API usage tracking per user

## 🔧 MANUAL CONFIGURATION REQUIRED

### 1. Password Policy (Dashboard Configuration)
**Location**: Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Settings → Password Policy

**Required Settings**:
```
✅ Minimum length: 12 characters
✅ Require uppercase letters: ON
✅ Require lowercase letters: ON  
✅ Require numbers: ON
✅ Require special characters: ON
✅ Password breach detection: ON
```

### 2. Storage Bucket Policies (Dashboard Configuration)
**Location**: Supabase Dashboard → Storage → Policies

**research-exports** (Private Bucket):
```sql
-- Policy Name: "Users can upload to their own folder"
-- Target roles: authenticated
-- Policy definition:
bucket_id = 'research-exports' AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
```

**user-uploads** (Private Bucket):
```sql
-- Policy Name: "Users can manage their own uploads"
-- Target roles: authenticated  
-- Policy definition:
bucket_id = 'user-uploads' AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
```

**visualizations** (Public Read, Private Write):
```sql
-- Policy Name: "Anyone can view visualizations" (SELECT)
-- Target roles: authenticated, anon
bucket_id = 'visualizations'

-- Policy Name: "Users can upload visualizations" (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE)
-- Target roles: authenticated
bucket_id = 'visualizations' AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
```

### 3. Email Templates (Security Notifications)
**Location**: Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Email Templates

Configure secure email templates for:
- Account confirmation
- Password reset
- Email change confirmation
- Security alerts

## 📊 SECURITY MONITORING & ALERTS

### Real-Time Security Monitoring
```sql
-- Check for suspicious activity
SELECT * FROM detect_suspicious_activity();

-- Monitor recent security events
SELECT * FROM error_logs 
WHERE severity IN ('high', 'critical') 
AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours';

-- Audit user activity
SELECT * FROM activity_logs 
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### Rate Limiting Implementation
The system now includes automatic rate limiting:
- **Session Creation**: Max 20 per hour per user
- **API Calls**: Max 1000 per hour per user  
- **Error Generation**: Max 10 critical errors per 10 minutes

### Audit Logging
All critical operations are automatically logged:
- Research session CRUD operations
- Graph data modifications
- Profile updates
- Security violations
- Rate limit breaches

## 🚨 SECURITY INCIDENT RESPONSE

### Emergency User Lock Function
```sql
-- Lock a user account immediately (admin only)
SELECT emergency_lock_user('user-uuid-here');
```

### Security Violation Detection
The system automatically detects and logs:
- Rapid session creation attempts
- Excessive API usage patterns
- Multiple authentication failures
- Suspicious data access patterns
- Rate limit violations

## 📈 CONTINUOUS SECURITY MONITORING

### Daily Security Checks
```sql
-- Run daily security audit
SELECT 
  table_name,
  CASE WHEN relrowsecurity THEN 'SECURE' ELSE 'VULNERABLE' END as rls_status
FROM information_schema.tables t
LEFT JOIN pg_class c ON c.relname = t.table_name
WHERE t.table_schema = 'public';

-- Check for security violations
SELECT COUNT(*) as violations_24h
FROM error_logs 
WHERE error_type IN ('SECURITY_WARNING', 'RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED', 'ACCESS_DENIED')
AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours';
```

### Weekly Security Reports
The system generates comprehensive security metrics:
- User activity patterns
- API usage trends  
- Security violation frequency
- Rate limiting effectiveness
- Data access patterns
