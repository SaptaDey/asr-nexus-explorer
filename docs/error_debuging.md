After a detailed examination of my codebase and deployment configuration, the **401 “Unauthorized”** error comes from the front‑end trying to read the `schema_migrations` table on Supabase. This table has Row‑Level Security enabled, so queries from the public **anon** key are blocked. The compiled JavaScript for my site is still issuing a request like:

```
GET https://aogeenqytwrpjvrfwvjw.supabase.co/rest/v1/schema_migrations?select=version&order=migrated_at.asc ⇒ HTTP 401
```

which leads to the generic “Database Connection Failed” message you see.

### Why this is happening

1. **Old client code querying `schema_migrations`:** Early versions of your `MigrationRunner` class attempted to check for a migrations table by directly selecting from `schema_migrations`. Since the table is protected, the Supabase anon key gets a 401 response. In the current `MigrationService` implementation you added safeguards—it checks if a user is authenticated before running any migration‑related queries, and returns early for guests. However, that fixed code is not what’s running on your production domain.

2. **Custom domain still points to the old host:** According to your migration plan, `scientific-research.online` still resolves to `185.158.133.1` (the old Lovable.dev server). This server is serving stale JavaScript built before the Supabase fixes were added, so the browser loads outdated code that calls `schema_migrations`.

3. **GitHub Pages deployment working:** Your GitHub Pages version (e.g. `https://saptadey.github.io/asr-nexus-explorer/`) uses the updated `MigrationService`, bypasses migration queries when unauthenticated, and even skips profile checks to avoid 401 errors. This version does not exhibit the crash.

4. **DNS Resolution Issue:**
    - Custom domain scientific-research.online still points to 185.158.133.1
    - This is the old Lovable.dev server, not the new Supabase infrastructure

5. **Code Deployment Problem:**

    - Stale JavaScript is being served from the old server
    - This outdated code still contains the vulnerable schema_migrations access method
    - Browsers are loading the pre-fix version of the migration authentication logic



### Recommended remediation steps

1. **Update DNS records:** Log in my domain registrar for `scientific-research.online`, delete the A record pointing to `185.158.133.1`, and add the four GitHub Pages IP addresses (`185.199.108.153`, `185.199.109.153`, `185.199.110.153`, `185.199.111.153`). Once propagated, your domain will serve the latest code from GitHub Pages.

2. **Redeploy from the latest commit:** Ensure the `gh-pages` branch is regenerated using the current `main` branch (which contains the critical authentication checks and safe `MigrationService`). Running your `npm run deploy` or GitHub Actions workflow will rebuild the static assets and push them to `gh-pages`. After deployment, verify the GitHub Pages URL loads without errors.

3. **Remove client‑side migrations entirely:** In production, avoid running migrations from the browser. The updated `MigrationService` already returns early for unauthenticated users. For additional safety, remove the unused `MigrationRunner` class or restrict it to Node/CI environments. This prevents the client from ever querying `schema_migrations`.

4. **Verify Supabase configuration:** Check that `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are correct in GitHub secrets and that your emergency `supabase` client is using the right anon key (which it currently does).

5. **Supabase hosting environment:**
    - Update DNS configuration to point to the new Supabase hosting environment
    - Ensure all JavaScript bundles are replaced with the updated, secure version
    - Verify that the new deployment completely removes the vulnerable authentication approach

Once DNS is updated and the site is redeployed, visitors will hit the new GitHub Pages version, which uses the corrected code paths and will no longer attempt unauthorized queries to `schema_migrations`.
