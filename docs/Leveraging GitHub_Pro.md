# Leveraging GitHub Pro for Smoother, Faster GitHub Pages Deployments

Upgrading from GitHub Free to GitHub Pro gives your biomedical web-application projects several immediate benefits: private-repo publishing to Pages, a larger free quota of Actions minutes and Codespaces hours, extra storage for Packages, stronger review tooling, and priority support. Together these features reduce friction when you build, test, secure, and deploy your React + Supabase sites to `scientific-research.online` while keeping costs near zero.

## 1. Private-Repository Publishing and Custom Domains

### 1.1 Pages from Private Repos

GitHub Pages can only publish directly from private repositories if the account is on Pro, Team, or Enterprise[^1][^2][^3]. With your Pro plan you may:

* Keep both app codebases private while they are under active development or while you handle licensed data.
* Push to a `gh-pages` branch (or trigger a Deployment workflow) and serve the final build publicly on the apex domain or any subdomain.


### 1.2 HTTPS and DNS Simplification

Pages automatically issues Let’s Encrypt TLS certificates—even for custom domains—so you no longer need an external CDN or manual certificate renewal[^4][^5][^6]. Simply add these DNS records once:

* `A` records → GitHub’s Pages IPs
* `CNAME` → `username.github.io` for subdomains
* Enable “Enforce HTTPS” in repo Settings.


## 2. Larger Free CI/CD Quota

GitHub Pro increases bundled GitHub Actions minutes to 3,000 per month and Packages storage to 2 GB[^7][^8][^9]. This matters because each push of your React projects triggers:

1. `npm ci` and `npm run build`.
2. Cypress or Playwright end-to-end tests (optional).
3. `actions/upload-pages-artifact` and `actions/deploy-pages`.

With 3,000 minutes you can run roughly 100 full builds of a medium React app monthly on free hosted runners before incurring charges.

![Resource allowance boost from GitHub Free to GitHub Pro.](https://ppl-ai-code-interpreter-files.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/46879095e06335c2a27ffb9ed250054a/d787e156-194c-496b-8f1b-14da26c09432/dcee88e0.png)

Resource allowance boost from GitHub Free to GitHub Pro.

## 3. Codespaces Time for Quick Hotfixes

Pro raises Codespaces allowance to 180 core-hours per month and 20 GB storage[^10][^11]. When an urgent bug appears:

1. Spin up a 2-core Codespace against the `main` branch (counts 1 core-hour for every 30 minutes).
2. Patch, commit, push, and it automatically redeploys via Actions.

Because compute and storage quotas reset monthly, sporadic hotfix sessions rarely exceed the free tier.

## 4. Advanced Review \& Repository Insights

### 4.1 Protected Branches and Required Reviewers

Pro unlocks protected-branch rules, multiple reviewers, and CODEOWNERS enforcement in private repos[^11][^12]. For your Supabase-backed apps:

* Mark `main` as protected; require status-check pass and at least one reviewer before merge.
* Define ownership of `src/db/**` to yourself and a collaborator in `CODEOWNERS`; merges touching SQL migrations must then be approved by a domain expert.


### 4.2 Insights Graphs

Traffic, Contributors, and Code Frequency graphs become available for private repositories on Pro[^13]. These help quantify adoption of the explorer tools and guide optimization.

## 5. Packages and Container Registry for Supabase Functions

If you package Supabase Edge Functions or containers, the included 2 GB Packages storage avoids separate registry fees[^14][^15]. Actions can push images tagged `ghcr.io/username/research-app:<sha>` during CI.

## 6. Higher Concurrency Ceilings

Pro doubles concurrent GitHub-hosted runner jobs to 40 and raises total workflow concurrency limits[^9][^16]. Result: simultaneous deploys of `scientific-research.online` and any other subdomains cannot block each other even on heavy commit days.

## 7. Support and SLA Advantages

* Email-based GitHub Support instead of community-only help[^17][^18].
* Faster ticket response useful when Pages fails to build or DNS validation stalls.


## 8. Practical Deployment Workflow (Sample)

```yaml
name: Deploy WebApp
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

permissions:
  pages: write
  id-token: write    # for OIDC JWT to Pages

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - name: Setup Node
      uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      with:
        node-version: 20
        cache: npm
    - run: npm ci && npm run build
      env:
        VITE_SUPABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.VITE_SUPABASE_URL }}
        VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY: ${{ secrets.VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY }}
    - uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
      with:
        path: ./dist
  deploy:
    needs: build
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - id: deployment
      uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

This pattern exploits:

* Pro’s private-repo Pages permission.
* Free Actions minutes.
* OIDC authentication (no PAT secrets).


## 9. Cost Projection After Upgrade

| Item | Free Plan | Pro Plan | Annual Impact |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Actions minutes | 2,000 | 3,000 | +50% builds capacity |
| Codespaces hours | 120 | 180 | +50% debugging capacity |
| Packages storage | 0.5 GB | 2 GB | Room for container images |
| Pages private repo | Not allowed | Included | Removes need for public-only workaround |
| Monthly price | \$0 | \$4 | ~\$48 year |

Even if you occasionally exceed the bundled limits, overage for Actions is billed at \$0.008 per extra minute; far lower than Lovable.dev hosting costs you plan to retire.

## 10. Recommended Next Steps

1. **Enable GitHub Pages → Source: GitHub Actions** in both private repositories.
2. Add branch protections and CODEOWNERS for critical directories.
3. Store Supabase keys in repository -level Secrets.
4. Transfer DNS to GitHub Pages IPs and enforce HTTPS.
5. Monitor Actions usage under Settings → Billing; raise concurrency only if 40-job cap is hit.

## Conclusion

Your GitHub Pro subscription removes the last blockers to a fully self-hosted, CI-driven deployment workflow. It unlocks private-repo publishing, doubles your free CI/CD resources, delivers stronger review gates, and supplies Codespaces for rapid fixes—all at a negligible monthly fee compared with prior Lovable.dev expenses. With these capabilities your scientific-research web apps can iterate quickly, stay secure, and serve users worldwide without extra hosting charges.
