# üö® CRITICAL: DNS Migration Required for scientific-research.online

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CURRENT STATUS: Domain Still Points to Old Hosting

**ISSUE IDENTIFIED**: The domain `scientific-research.online` is currently still pointing to the old hosting provider (Cloudflare IP: 185.158.133.1) instead of GitHub Pages.

**EVIDENCE**:
- Current DNS Resolution: `185.158.133.1` (Cloudflare)
- Expected GitHub Pages IPs: `185.199.108.153`, `185.199.109.153`, `185.199.110.153`, `185.199.111.153`
- Site still shows Lovable.dev branding and `#lovable-badge` elements

## URGENT: DNS Records Must Be Updated

The GitHub Pages deployment is complete, but DNS records MUST be updated to complete the migration.

### Required DNS Records

Add the following A records for scientific-research.online:

```
Type: A
Name: @
Value: 185.199.108.153

Type: A
Name: @
Value: 185.199.109.153

Type: A
Name: @
Value: 185.199.110.153

Type: A
Name: @
Value: 185.199.111.153
```

For www subdomain (optional):
```
Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: SaptaDey.github.io
```

### Steps to Complete

1. **Log in to your domain registrar** (where you purchased scientific-research.online)
2. **Navigate to DNS settings**
3. **Add the A records** listed above
4. **Wait for DNS propagation** (can take up to 24-48 hours)
5. **GitHub will automatically provision SSL certificate** once DNS is verified

### Current Status

- ‚úÖ GitHub Pages deployed successfully
- ‚úÖ Custom domain configured in GitHub
- ‚ùå **DNS still points to old hosting (185.158.133.1)**
- ‚ùå **Site still served from Lovable.dev/Cloudflare**
- ‚è≥ **CRITICAL**: DNS update required for migration completion
- ‚è≥ SSL certificate will be issued after DNS verification

### Verify DNS Configuration

**BEFORE DNS UPDATE** (current status):
```bash
$ nslookup scientific-research.online
Name: scientific-research.online
Address: 185.158.133.1  # ‚ùå OLD HOSTING (Cloudflare)
```

**AFTER DNS UPDATE** (expected result):
```bash
$ nslookup scientific-research.online
Name: scientific-research.online
Address: 185.199.108.153  # ‚úÖ GITHUB PAGES
```

**Verification Commands**:
```bash
nslookup scientific-research.online
dig scientific-research.online
curl -I https://scientific-research.online  # Should show GitHub headers
```

### Access URLs

- **GitHub Pages URL**: https://saptadey.github.io/asr-nexus-explorer/ ‚úÖ **WORKING**
- **Custom Domain (OLD)**: https://scientific-research.online/ ‚ö†Ô∏è **STILL ON LOVABLE.DEV**
- **Custom Domain (NEW)**: https://scientific-research.online/ üéØ **AFTER DNS UPDATE**

### üöÄ MIGRATION CHECKLIST

**BEFORE DNS UPDATE**:
- [ ] Backup current site data if needed
- [ ] Verify GitHub Pages deployment is working
- [ ] Test Supabase integration on GitHub Pages URL

**DNS UPDATE PROCESS**:
- [ ] Delete/Replace current A record pointing to 185.158.133.1
- [ ] Add new A records pointing to GitHub Pages IPs
- [ ] Wait 24-48 hours for DNS propagation
- [ ] Verify domain resolves to GitHub Pages
- [ ] Confirm SSL certificate is issued automatically

**AFTER DNS UPDATE**:
- [ ] Test full functionality on custom domain
- [ ] Cancel old hosting subscription (Lovable.dev)
- [ ] Monitor for any issues

### üîß TROUBLESHOOTING

If after DNS update the site doesn't work:
1. **Check DNS propagation**: Use https://whatsmydns.net/
2. **Clear browser cache**: Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. **Wait for SSL**: Certificate issuance can take 30 minutes
4. **Check GitHub Pages status**: Visit repository Settings ‚Üí Pages

Once DNS propagates and SSL certificate is issued, HTTPS will be automatically enforced.
