Based on my comprehensive security review of the ASR-GoT research web application, I've identified severalÂ critical security vulnerabilitiesÂ that need immediate attention. The application has significant security gaps that could expose user data, research content, and credentials.

ðŸš¨Â CRITICAL SECURITY FINDINGS

1. SEVERE RLS POLICY VULNERABILITIES

- CRITICAL:Â query_sessions,Â query_figures, andÂ query_tablesÂ haveÂ Allow all operationsÂ policies withÂ qual:trueÂ -Â COMPLETE BYPASS OF AUTHORIZATION

- CRITICAL: These policies allow any authenticated user to access, modify, or delete ANY user's research data

- CRITICAL: Research content, analyses, and figures are completely exposed across all users

2. HARDCODED CREDENTIALS EXPOSURE

- CRITICAL: Supabase URL and anon key are hardcoded in multiple locations (src/integrations/supabase/client.ts,Â .env,Â .env.example)

- CRITICAL: The anon keyÂ eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...Â is publicly exposed in the codebase

- MEDIUM: Environment variables contain placeholder API keys that could be accidentally committed

3. XSS VULNERABILITIES

- HIGH: MultipleÂ dangerouslySetInnerHTMLÂ usages without proper sanitization:

    - src/components/asr-got/HTMLResultsDisplay.tsxÂ (lines 105, 211)

    - src/components/ui/chart.tsxÂ (lines 79-80)

    - src/pages/ASRGoTInterface.tsxÂ (line 569)

- HIGH: DirectÂ innerHTMLÂ manipulation in several files without sanitization

- MEDIUM: User-generated content from research queries not properly escaped

4. INSECURE CREDENTIAL STORAGE

- HIGH: API keys stored in localStorage/sessionStorage without encryption in legacy code

- HIGH: Deprecated credential storage functions still accessible

- MEDIUM: Client-side credential validation exposes API keys to network inspection

5. AUTHENTICATION BYPASS RISKS

- HIGH: Database functions missingÂ SECURITY DEFINERÂ andÂ search_pathÂ protection

- HIGH: No proper session validation in critical operations

- MEDIUM: Missing leaked password protection (disabled in Supabase)

ðŸ”§ COMPREHENSIVE SECURITY FIX PLAN
## PHASE 1: CRITICAL RLS POLICY FIXES (IMMEDIATE)

1. Fix Database Authorization Bypass

- Replace Allow all operations policies with proper user-scoped restrictions
- Add qual:(auth.uid() = user_id) to query_sessions, query_figures, query_tables
- Implement proper session ownership validation for related tables

2. Secure Database Functions

- Add SECURITY DEFINER and SET search_path TO '' to all functions
- Fix function search path mutability warnings

3. Enable Security Features

- Enable leaked password protection in Supabase
- Add rate limiting to authentication endpoints

## PHASE 2: CREDENTIAL SECURITY HARDENING

4. Remove Hardcoded Credentials

- Move Supabase configuration to environment variables
- Remove public anon key from source code
- Implement proper secret management

5. Secure API Key Storage

- Remove deprecated insecure storage functions
- Enforce SecureCredentialManager usage
- Add automatic credential cleanup

## PHASE 3: XSS PROTECTION

6. Sanitize All HTML Content

- Replace all dangerouslySetInnerHTML with DOMPurify sanitization
- Implement CSP headers for additional protection
- Add output encoding for user-generated content

7. Secure Content Rendering

- Sanitize research content before display
- Validate Plotly configurations
- Escape all user inputs

## PHASE 4: INPUT VALIDATION & MONITORING

8. Implement Comprehensive Input Validation

- Add server-side validation for all API endpoints
- Implement rate limiting and request size limits
- Add CSRF protection

9. Security Monitoring

- Add security event logging
- Implement anomaly detection
- Add audit trails for sensitive operations

## PHASE 5: AUTHENTICATION HARDENING

10. Strengthen Authentication

- Implement proper session management
- Add MFA support
- Enhance password security requirements

11. Add Authorization Checks

- Implement resource-level authorization
- Add permission-based access control
- Validate all data access operations


The application has critical security vulnerabilities that allow complete bypass of data protection. The RLS policies are fundamentally broken, allowing any user to access any other user's research data. Combined with XSS vulnerabilities and insecure credential handling, this creates a severe security risk for a research platform handling sensitive scientific data.

## IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED: The database authorization system must be fixed before the application can be safely used in production.
